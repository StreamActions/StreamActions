## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report vulnerabilities by emailing us at [streamactionshelp@gmail.com](mailto:streamactionshelp@gmail.com). Please put **[SECURITY]** in the subject to grab our attention.

We will try our best to reach out to you quickly, confirm the issue, reproduce it, and work on a fix.

If you are able to contribute a fix yourself, we would appreciate it, but it is not required.

We ask that you not reveal the details of exploiting the vulnerability until we have had time to release a fix and allowed sufficient time for users to update.
