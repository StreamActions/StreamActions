Keep in mind that StreamActions-Bot is highly customizable in a number of ways and we strongly prefer that you consider these options before filing this issue:

* Tweak StreamActions-Bot's configuration.
* Install or create a community package.
* Use the GraphQL API to handle the feature in an external program.

If you're convinced that none of these options are appropriate for the feature you want, please explain why that's the case by completely filling out the issue template below.

Also note that the StreamActions team has finite resources so it's unlikely that we'll work on all feature requests. If we're interested in a particular feature however, we'll follow up and ask you to submit an RFC to talk about it in more detail.
